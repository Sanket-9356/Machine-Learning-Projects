# 🏡 USA Housing Price Prediction  

This project builds a **Linear Regression model** to predict housing prices in the USA based on key features like area income, house age, number of rooms, and population.

## 📌 Dataset  
- **Features**:  
  - `Avg. Area Income` → Average income of residents in the area  
  - `Avg. Area House Age` → Average age of houses in the area  
  - `Avg. Area Number of Rooms` → Average number of rooms per house  
  - `Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms` → Average number of bedrooms per house  
  - `Area Population` → Population of the area  
- **Target**:  
  - `Price` → Predicted housing price

## ⚙️ Project Workflow  
1. **Load Data** from GitHub  
2. **Explore Data** (head, info, summary stats, null checks)  
3. **Visualize** relationships using plots  
4. **Preprocess** (feature selection, scaling if needed)  
5. **Split Data** into Train/Test sets  
6. **Train Model** (Linear Regression)  
7. **Evaluate Model** using R², MAE, MSE, RMSE  
8. **Make Predictions**
